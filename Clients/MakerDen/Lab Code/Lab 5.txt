In this lab we are giving the Netduino a unique device identifier.  

The recommendation is to use the network MAC Address which you will find printed underneath the Netduino.

If you dont use the MAC address just ensure you use a sequence of alphanurmic 
characters that are unique such as your email address

Leave all code from the previous lab in place and only modify the StartNetworkServices Line and add
the additional device identifier parameter


StartNetworkServices("emul", true, "your device identifier goes here");
