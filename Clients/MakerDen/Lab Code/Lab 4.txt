Add the following lines of code to the program.cs file


Add this code before the first using statement

//Replace the "emul" which is the name of the device with a unique 3 to 5 character name
//use your initials or something similar.  This code will be visible on the IoT Dashboard
StartNetworkServices("emul", true);

Delete the while loop and its enclosed code.
After the last using statement add these event handlers and the thread.sleep statements
The implementation for the event handlers is in the MakerBase.cs


light.OnBeforeMeasurement += OnBeforeMeasure;
light.OnAfterMeasurement += OnMeasureCompleted;
temp.OnBeforeMeasurement += OnBeforeMeasure;
temp.OnAfterMeasurement += OnMeasureCompleted;
Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);


Your main section code should now look like

 // main code marker            

//Replace the "emul" which is the name of the device with a unique 3 to 5 character name
//use your initials or something similar.  This code will be visible on the IoT Dashboard
StartNetworkServices("emul", true);

using (SensorTemp temp = new SensorTemp(Pins.GPIO_PIN_D8, 10000, "temp01"))
using (SensorLight light = new SensorLight(AnalogChannels.ANALOG_PIN_A0, 1000, "light01"))
using (rgb = new RgbLed(Pins.GPIO_PIN_D3, Pins.GPIO_PIN_D5, Pins.GPIO_PIN_D6, "rgb01"))
{
    temp.OnBeforeMeasurement += OnBeforeMeasure;
    temp.OnAfterMeasurement += OnMeasureCompleted;
    light.OnBeforeMeasurement += OnBeforeMeasure;
    light.OnAfterMeasurement += OnMeasureCompleted;
    Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
}




ACTIONS
1) copying and pasting the code
2) ensure the Ethernet cable is plugged in to the Netduino connected to the Internet
3) press Start button in the Visual Studio Toolbar to deply the code to the device and start it running
4) You should now be publishing data.
5) Check the main Maker Den screen running the "Internet of Things Dashboard" 
6) or run the Internet of Things Dashboard locally - it is pinned to the Windows Taskbar
